# MINDS_COKG
Programming assignment for MINDS and Center on Knowledge Graphs Position

To reproduce the results run "python main.py"

I have used mainly 2 sentiment analyzers which is TextBlob and VADER analyzer.

These 2 analyzers are mainly from NLTK library which are predominantly used for sentiment analysis. 

The results have been published as screenshots which you can find out in the github repo.

The polarity(sentiment) such as the overall sentiment remained positive from 1st May to 15th May for both the analyzers.

But the polarity(sentiment) regarding doge and shib was decreasing gradually as visible from the charts shown.
